How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    There are a few methods to ensure that my code is functional and secure. The first is validating input and setting contraints on variables. In Content.Java I set guidelines for the length of variables and formatting of contact info.
    Another method is unit testing. I implemented JUint testing to ensure my code was behaving as intended. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    One way to interpret user needs is to gather info from the user to efficiently get to the solution they are looking for. For example, sorting contacts in a specific matter. In addition, I can make sure that my interface is user-friendly
    and that modifications could easily be made without breaking the fuctionality/efficency of the code. 
    
How do I approach designing software?
    The most important and first thing I do is ensure that I understand the requirements of the project. If I do not fully understand, I ask questions until I have a clear vision of the direction I need to take. My next course of outline would
    be to write up psuedocode and get a rough idea of how my code will look. From there, I dive in and tweak things along the way as needed.
